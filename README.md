# Profiling commands

In this repo, you will find profiling and the datapack used to profile the different commands.

You can find a table with the results [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MuJ502TvldKbAeKg5fsFehW8ljB8_V6mLgdN_ViFhB8/edit?usp=sharing).

This test **doesnt take into account** the selectors efficiency. For more about informations about this, check [this chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z0XVvyfzVSGstmpLSMKnwlxwYg8N2ZFl3Xmh0ZV0yZU/edit#gid=0) made by [@Dominexis](https://github.com/Dominexis).

The commands have been tested in two ways: with score holders and with UUID access, so as said above, no selector have been used.
